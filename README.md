#Data Structures

##Introduction/Motivation

This repo is designed to get me familiar with data structure implementations for life and so on.  It's definitely nice to have a high-level knowledge of data structures, but between getting familiar with low-level details and knowing the peculiarities of the structures themselves, there's no real substitute to knowing the real thing.  

I'm most comfortable with C++ at this point, so this repo will be written entirely in that language.

##Goals

1. Become familiar with data structures and some peculiarities that may not be apparent from a high-level vantage point.  

2. Create a data structure "library," while reducing duplication as much as possible through inheritance and templating.

3. Maybe make something useful as a reference or future utility?  I dunno.
