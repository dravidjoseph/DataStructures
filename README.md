#Data Structures

##Introduction/Motivation

This repo is designed to get me familiar with data structure implementations for life and so on.  It's definitely nice to have a high-level knowledge of data structures, but between getting familiar with low-level details and knowing the peculiarities of the structures themselves, there's no real substitute to knowing the real thing.  

C++ is powerful, but the overhead in creating a program in my experience is huge.  I generally like to make sure my program documentation is sufficient, and combined with creating new header files, makefiles, and so on just to get a basic program can get to be a bit much.  I'm also not very comfortable using tools that generate that sort of information-at my level, they seem to lead to rabbit holes that would be detrimental to go down at this point.

By creating the basic template for the data structures I want (and writing them myself so I can understand what is going on), I can easily expand the class functionality method by method without having to generate a whole mess of code just to test one tiny thing.  


I'm most comfortable with C++ at this point, so this repo will be written entirely in that language.



##Goals

1. Become familiar with data structures and some peculiarities that may not be apparent from a high-level vantage point.  

2. Create a data structure "library," while reducing duplication as much as possible through inheritance and templating.

3. Maybe make something useful as a reference or future utility?  I dunno.
